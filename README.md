# Sketchup Plugin: Organize Materials

## Description
I'm not sure I remember what this does, and this repo was put up after finding this code in a dusty bin so to speak. I know I used it to prep sketchup scenes for use in 3DS Max. It may be that this tool explodes all groups and geometry (in a Sketchup scene) onto one layer (all geometry merged, not grouped), then collects polygons that have the same material applied into respective groups. If I use this again and figure out what it does I may update this documentation.

I may have posted this to some Sketchup tools archive or forum on the internet, and if so maybe I documented this there.

# LICENSE
I wrote this (except for some reference materials) and I dedicate it to the Public Domain. I believe those reference materials / code sources are effectively Public Domain.
